NOTE FROM PAULO: even though some members seem to be doing more tasks than another (like in my case),
I believe that the tasks were well distributed overall. Everyone contributed and participated on what was
stablished since the very beggining. I took the lead to do some extra work like debugging due my experience with
debbuging, but the team worked very well together.
